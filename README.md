# React 19 Nested Component Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle rendering bug encountered in React 19 when using the new `use` syntax with deeply nested components.  The bug manifests as unexpected behavior or silent failures, often without clear error messages.

The `NestedComponentBug.jsx` file contains the problematic code.  The solution, demonstrating a fix, is provided in `NestedComponentSolution.jsx`.

The core issue involves the complex interaction between the `use` hook and the component's lifecycle in deeply nested structures. The solution focuses on optimizing the component structure and ensuring proper cleanup.
